            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23686:5"/> Vpon this ground (all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons receiuing perfection from their end) all vnderſtanding men haue beene wont to Praeface all great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations for the common good, with ſome ſuch religious Acts, as did beſt conduce to the glory of God. <hi>A Ioue Principium,</hi> was the law of Nature; the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were wont to begin from their Altars and their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. It was euer the ſtile of the Ciuill Law to begin, <hi>A Deo optimo maximo;</hi> and our old Saxon Lawes, had the ten great Praecepts of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue prefixed in their Front. But Gods Children euer vſed eſpecially to conſult vvith GOD, to auſpicate all their ſolemne Actions with Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, faſtings, ſacrifices, Sacraments; making their Creatour, who is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of all Creatures, the beginning and the end of all their actions.</p>
            <p>We find in the old Teſtament, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> beeing to warre againſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23686:5"/> the <hi>Beniamites, Three ſeueral times they went vp to aske counſell at the mouth of God,</hi> Iudg. 20. 26. And it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the New, that though the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt himſelfe had ſeparated <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> to that great Worke, the Conuerſion of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> yet the Church would not diſmiſſe them, till they were conſecrated by <hi>faſting, prayer,</hi> and <hi>impoſition of hands.</hi> Act. 13. 3. For Sacraments in particular, thoſe two notable actions in the holy Story. The firſt, that powerfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was Vſher'd in with the cebelratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holy Paſſeouer: And the ſecond, that memorable Redemption of mankinde from the bondage of ſinne, by the Paſſion of CHRIST our Sauiour, bleſſed for euer, Hee himſelfe aggrauated by the ſolemne Sacrament of his laſt Supper.</p>

God that made all things for his owne glory, is certainly the beſt aſsiſtant to his own end. Hath not, thinke you, the deuill domineer'd in their hearts, who haue ſet a marke vpon your two laſt <hi>Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Aſsemblies,</hi> as if your endeuors

            <p>Had you not intended Gods glory, certainely you would neuer haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with Gods Sacrament? But two coole words with theſe malicious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectors. Was their Gun-powder Plot the worſe for their Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? or their Sacrament the worſe for that plot? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is a communicatiue power in euill as well as in good: an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Sacrifice was a well fitted Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to a murderous end. But is there no difference betwixt their waſhing their hands in bloud, &amp; our waſhing our hands in innocency? Betwixt the intention of butchering of Kings and Kingdomes, and preſeruing of Kings
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23686:7"/> and Kingdomes? But I remember we are going to the Altar: the GOD of mercy conuert the hearts of theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious furies, theſe wily <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> who while they dwell among vs, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to deceiue vs, with the pretence of <hi>Antiquitie,</hi> their <hi>old ſhooes</hi> of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> their <hi>old garments</hi> of their owne <hi>merit,</hi> their <hi>old mouldy Bread</hi> of <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> with all which, though <hi>put on but yeſterday,</hi> they endeuour to <hi>deceiue</hi> Ioſhua <hi>and his people;</hi> and wee finde they did it too, but it was becauſe they <hi>asked not counſell of the Lord,</hi> Ioſ. 9. 14. Let vs therfore to preuent the like wiles, goe on in the <hi>Name of the Lord,</hi> whom we come to ſerue, &amp; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> reſolution will infallibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Dauids</hi> bleſsing. So holy meanes cannot but produce a happy end.</p>
            <p>But that Truth may run on with order, the maine generall parts of the Text, are a <hi>Praeparation,</hi> &amp; a <hi>Reſolution;</hi> The firſt, a <hi>Praeface;</hi> the ſecond, the <hi>Worke</hi> it ſelfe. The firſt, a <hi>Condition</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,

But not to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize ſo diuine a Rite from Infidels; In the Old Law, wee finde Sanctity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer accompanied with Decency; the Lauer was placed before the Altar, and Cleanſing was euer the Praeface to Offering. And in the New Law, 'tis our Sauiours Ordinance, that wee beginne with <hi>Baptizing;</hi> and 'twas his owne practice, to <hi>Waſh his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles feete,</hi> before the LORDS SVPPER: Not that Hee would haue vs inſiſt in the outward Act; No, the very Legall Waſhing, was the inſtruction of inward Cleanſing. And our <hi>Abſolution</hi> heere, it ſounds <hi>Regeneration, Repentance, Renoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two eminent Lauers in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23686:10"/> the Goſpell, the firſt, Chriſts Bathe, a hot Bathe, <hi>Lavacrum Sanguinis,</hi> the Lauer of CHRISTS Bloud; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Our Bathe, a cold Bathe, <hi>Lava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum Lachrymarum,</hi> the Lauer of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Theſe two mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will proue a ſoueraigne Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, wrought firſt by CHRIST himſelfe, when Hee ſweat water and bloud.</p>
            <p>The firſt is as that Poole of <hi>Batheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> into which whoſoeuer <hi>enters</hi> with <hi>Faith,</hi> is <hi>healed;</hi> The bloud of Chriſt is the true Lauer of Regeneration; a Fountaine ſet open for <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to waſh in. <hi>The bloud of Chriſt purgeth vs from all ſinnes,</hi> 1 Ioh. 1. 7. Wee account it Charitie in Mothers, to feede their Children with their owne Milke: How deare is the loue of Chriſt, that both Waſheth and Feedes vs with his owne Bloud? No ſooner are wee borne in Chriſt, but iuſt as our Mothers, ſo Chriſts bloud
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23686:11"/> is turned into Milke, nouriſhing vs to euerlaſting Saluation. What is <hi>Calamus Beniamini,</hi> or <hi>Storax,</hi> or a <hi>thouſand Riuers of Oyle,</hi> to make vs cleane, except the Lord purge and cleanſe vs? No, 'tis His bloud that <hi>ſpeakes better things than the bloud of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel:</hi> Vnto Him therefore that loued vs, and waſhed vs from our ſinnes in his owne Bloud, and hath made vs KINGS and PRIESTS to GOD His Father: to Him bee glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and dominion for euer, <hi>Reuelation</hi> 1. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>But yet 'tis the ſecond Bathe, the Lauer of Repentance, that muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and make the firſt Operatiue. This Bathe of <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, it is a kind of Rebaptizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, giuing ſtrength and effect to the firſt waſhing. And it implyes a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Act: Firſt, To bruiſe our hearts by <hi>Contrition;</hi> Secondly, To lay our wounds open by <hi>Confeſsion</hi> to God;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23686:11"/> Thirdly, to waſh our hands in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, by <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to men.</p>
            <p>The Sacrifice of a broken heart, makes a happy way to the Sacrifice of the Altar. <hi>Lachrymae pondera vocis habent,</hi> our teares are the beſt Harbingers wee can ſend before vs, our ſilent Orators to GOD; <hi>Quae veniam non poſtulant, ſed obtinent,</hi> as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, they ſpeede without asking, and neuer returne from GOD without obtayning. It troubled my Soule in theſe times of Tryall, to perceiue the hearts of men filled with diſtracted thoughts, their mouthes with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Obloquyes: Had they turned theſe Paſſions into ſound Repentance, they would ſoone haue found more eaſe to their Soules. Through this Red Sea of Sorrow, all <hi>our</hi> FATHERS <hi>were wont to paſſe to the Land of Promiſe, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their enemies,</hi> their ſins, all <hi>ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23686:12"/> vp in thoſe Waters,</hi> and by theſe bleſſed Streames they were cleanſed, not onely from ciuill and temporall, but ſpirituall and eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So <hi>Abimelech, Hezekiah, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſseh, Iob,</hi> the <hi>Niniuites.</hi> So the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites;</hi> 'tis true, twice they went vp to <hi>aske Councell of God,</hi> and were ouerthrowne by the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> but the third time, when they went vp to GODS Houſe, and <hi>ſate Wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and Faſting, from Morne till E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> then they ouerthrew <hi>Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> and <hi>Slew twenty-fiue thouſand men of thoſe that drew the Sword,</hi> Iudg. 20. 35.</p>
            <p>This is the third time, my Worthy Auditors, that you haue come vp to this Houſe of God, and if heretofore yee haue fayl'd of your good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I feare twas for want of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Repentance.

Yee now preſent the whole body of the Land, and therefore now before you approach the <hi>Altar,</hi> Repent for the whole body of the Land. Certainly we haue no Purgatory but true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, no holy water but this, can quench the fire of Luſt and Hell.</p>
            <p>I know there is no good ſoule here, which is not wounded at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſinnes of our Nation, and yet which of vs all, haue euer happily ſhed one teare, either for our owne ſinnes, or the ſinnes of the people? Alas! that we ſhould not yeelde one droppe for thoſe offences; which coſt our Sauiour many ſtreames of blood to waſh them away. I would faine dwell vpon this ſweete vertue, but your deuotions muſt ſupply, what the time detracts. And if yee cannot
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23686:13"/> ſhedde a teare, giue a ſigh for our ſins; if not that, repent that you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: our ſinnes begat our ſorrow, let our ſorrow deuoure our ſinnes, as the Worme the Tree that bred it: VVaſh and waſh now, for, <hi>ad Aras conſulere,</hi> it is too late, to waſh at the Altar.</p>
            <p>Waſh now and waſh all, from the Crowne of the Head, to the ſole of the Foote, there is nothing in vs but Woundes, and Sores: yet aboue all, there is ſome-thing here in it that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> waſheth his hands.

            <p>Not that all this <hi>waſhing</hi> and <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> of ours ſufficeth to ſalvation, without Gods <hi>Altar:</hi> If it had, it is likely <hi>Dauid</hi> would haue gone no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Nay euen when wee are at the <hi>Altar; in Altari non inuenit viam, qui in Chriſto non inuenit cauſam: Not by the
